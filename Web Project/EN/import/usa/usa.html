                <p>IAAI.com IAAI (Insurance Auto Auction Inc) The largest auto auction in America was founded in 1982
                     This year. Scott Bradley in Los Angeles, California, is his original sack
                     There was Los Angeles Auto Salvage. <br> By that time everything was connected
                     The sale of damaged cars was associated with fraud. Scott decided
                     It created a place to sort cars that were not yet recoverable
                     There were cars that were just ungodly. This is how I called auctions where
                     They bought insurance for damaged cars. <br> Insurance Companies Will Pay
                     Alerts clients to the damage, theft, sinking, burning, etc. of their car
                     These cars are either destroyed or sold at auto auctions, which is exactly their number
                     IAAI (Insurance Auto Auction Inc) <br> About 5000 auto transports daily
                     It is auctioned at 50-60% lower than its market value.</p>
